# 🚀 GitHub Action Repo - Webhook Trigger

This repository is used to simulate GitHub events (Push, Pull Request, and optionally Merge) that trigger a webhook configured to send data to a Flask server (`webhook-repo`).

---

## 🔁 Purpose

To generate real-time GitHub events for:

- Push
- Pull Request
- Merge

These events are captured by a webhook and sent to a backend server for storage and visualization.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/action-repo.git
cd action-repo
```
Perform actions like:

These actions will send webhook data to the URL configured in Settings > Webhooks.
